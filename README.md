## Description

This study has developed DeepHotResi, a deep learning framework for predicting hotspot residues in protein-
RNA complexes. The method integrates contact maps from protein structures, sequence data, and features derived
from the esmfold model, employing Graph Attention Networks for accurate prediction. To address data limitations, a
new, larger dataset was employed, significantly improving the modelâ€™s effectiveness. The experimental results show that
DeepHotResi can effectively identify hotspots in protein-RNA complexes, and it outperforms existing methods.

## System and hardware requirements

DeepHotResi has been tested on Linux (Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz 
processesor and 16GB of memory allotment)
