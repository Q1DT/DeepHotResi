## Description
In this study, we introduce DeepHotResi, a sequence-based computational method designed to predict hotspot residues in protein-RNA complexes. 

DeepHotResi leverages a pre-trained protein language model to predict protein structure and generate an amino acid contact map. To enhance feature representation, DeepHotResi integrates the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module, which processes diverse amino acid-level features. 

Next, it constructs an amino acid feature network from the contact map and SE-Module-derived features. Finally, DeepHotResi employs a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model hotspot residue prediction as a graph node classification task.

Experimental results demonstrate that DeepHotResi outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively identifying hotspot residues in protein RNA complexes with superior accuracy on the test set.

##  The trained model

The models with trained parameters are put in the directory `` ./Model'``

## Usage
### âš™ Network Architecture
Our model is implemented in ``DeepHotResi.py``.
You can run "train.py" to train the deep model from stratch and use the "test.py" to test the test datasets with the trained model.


**Model Training**

Run 
```
python train.py
``` 

**Model Testing**

Run 
```
python test.py
```
